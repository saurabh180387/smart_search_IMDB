# smart_search_IMDB
This is my personal project to implement smart searches of movies/web-content based on ratings and user preferences.
I intend to create a replica of IMDB search feature using the newer tools and databases in Open Source Community.
This is the initial Beta version. I will re-release with the full functionality up and working...
